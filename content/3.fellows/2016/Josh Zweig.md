Yale University 5 2022 Processing Fellow Processing Foundation 2021 Adobe Design Circle Scholar Do not apply to this or trust IEEE/Adobe programs\. They did not adequately inform me of financial aid coverage, denied to offer me financial assistance for extreme extenuating circumstances that they had offered other scholars, and redirected me to 'mentorship resources' as a 'substitute' for financial aid\. If you are in legitimate financial need, IEEE & Adobe distribute their assistance extremely late — if your institution charges additional late fees, you will not be covered in time and will have to face the burden of these fees\. Adobe & IEEE are incredibly uncooperative, will acknowledge your extenuating circumstances, and then refuse contact with you for an entire month\. Their staff was incredibly rude and dismissive in our exchanges, and the program faced several employee turnovers in a span of two years—if that is any additional indicator\. They are not interested in assisting students with actual financial need and are moreso interested in tax cuts\.  Even Palantir was better at distributing financial assistance than Adobe\.  1 of 10 in Adobe's inaugural scholarship for undergraduates in design\.
