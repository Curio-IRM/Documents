Accessible systems thinker.

Designing with a user centered focus to ensure that users’ wants and needs are at the forefront of the design process. Passionate about accessible design, ensuring all potential users have equal opportunities regardless of ability, prior opportunities, experiences, or skillsets. I am not an expert (regarding accessibility), I just really care. 

Experienced in design systems building accessible, scalable components to be deployed across products with documentation. Proficient with WCAG guidelines and screen reader annotations for VoiceOver and TalkBack, but striving to learn more. Currently focused on learning and improving localization alongside accessibility concerns. Tackling design through accessibility lenses and accounting for all, including environmental and situational disabilities.

Always seeking opportunities to grow as an individual and designer alongside my peers.

UW Bothell Design Jam 2 2021 1st Place Coding With Kids Redesign Awarded first place for the Coding With Kids Redesign challenge in DubsTech’s 2020 Protothon amongst 280 participants. See above project for more details. DubsTech 5 2020 Washington State Opportunity Scholarship Recipient 4-year recipient of the WSOS scholarship. WSOS reduces barriers to education and training and facilitates entry into high-demand careers by supporting low and middle income Washington students pursuing high-demand majors in science, technology, engineering, math (STEM), or health care. Washington State Opportunity Scholarship 9 2018 Homemore 2 2021 3 2021 Homelessness is a major issue that has swept the United States and they are often underserved by services. Disabled people, people who use drugs, and minors/vulnerable populations often find themselves without a safe home.

Access to medical services is also crucial, especially in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, and we wanted to design a service that would allow people to see where free medical services were offered, and other helpful resources.

Many people might find the idea of building an app for the homeless contradictory, but a large percentage the homeless population own cell phones that serve as a lifeline and allow them to search for resources. Mobile phone ownership by homeless individuals ranged from 44%-62% in 2016. There are existing apps designed for a non-homeless person to aid homeless people. However, Homemore is an app designed FOR the homeless individual to help themselves.
