Washington State Opportunity Scholarship 9 2018 Homemore 2 2021 3 2021 Homelessness is a major issue that has swept the United States and they are often underserved by services\. Disabled people, people who use drugs, and minors/vulnerable populations often find themselves without a safe home\.  Access to medical services is also crucial, especially in the midst of the COVID\-19 pandemic, and we wanted to design a service that would allow people to see where free medical services were offered, and other helpful resources\.  Many people might find the idea of building an app for the homeless contradictory, but a large percentage the homeless population own cell phones that serve as a lifeline and allow them to search for resources\. Mobile phone ownership by homeless individuals ranged from 44%\-62% in 2016\. There are existing apps designed for a non\-homeless person to aid homeless people\. However, Homemore is an app designed FOR the homeless individual to help themselves\.
