We designed and developed a platform and intelligent algorithm to increase the efficiency of housekeepers. By factoring in room vacancy, guest location, check in/out status and other pre-existing Hilton data, the algorithm can create and update a live list of rooms for housekeepers to visit, saving (on average) 92 hours of transition time a month.

It provides real time data on areas that have been searched, allowing rescuers to tag space with relevant information. The goal is to prevent duplication of effort and maximize number of lives saved.

In addition, completed a series of inputs to locate various flags. 4 2017 CNY Hackathon 2016, 3rd Place 11 2016 The Girl Scout Gold Award As an 80-hour community service project to complete my work as a Girl Scout of 10 years, I created a Skin Cancer Awareness curriculum. It has been implemented at multiple schools across Los Angeles, CA and is available for download at www.keepingmyskinsafe.com. Girl Scout's of Greater Los Angeles 10 2014 MLB Advanced Media Challenge 11 2016 11 2016 In an effort to increase the personalization of the customer's experience at the ballpark, my team and I created an additional facet to the already built "MLB Ballpark" app. Using augmented reality we created the wireframe of an interface a user can interact with on top of a live camera feed (similar to Pok√©mon GO). This would include scanning the field and being able to tap on players and get instant information, or walking around the ballpark and seeing various virtual items pop up on the camera footage screen to then click for more information. And to keep user's retained during the off-season, allowing users to scan player's favorite restaurants or places to go, receive points and then a perk before the season begins. At the conclusion of the project we pitched our idea to MLBAM's employees.  standardizedContributor Pippa Thomas Product Manager at Instacart 2732417 Instacart https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C4D0BAQHF65cU34mbxw/company-logo_400_400/0/1648482785824?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=4NXDJ8gUXg6qgp4Q3gNA1eXShP5trTQ2NtynKjl_TX0 https://www.linkedin.com/company/instacart/ 1001 5000 7 2020 San Francisco, California, United States 6 2022 Instacart Alcohol, gifting, emerging business Product Manager Full-time Microsoft Office Java Computer Science Public Speaking Coding Languages Computer Hardware Educational Technology Python True 1375 500 mkokot Michael Kokot Product @ Instacart https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C5603AQESmaLnlSA3tA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1583337498322?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=KfIFM6II1gnsvJcAaFuK-s8QDurtkCn-M8yEITRkJac elizabethcreichert Elizabeth C.
