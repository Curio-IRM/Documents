Stanford University School of Engineering 4 2022 Signideo: Automatic American Sign Language (ASL) Alphabet Transcription for Video-Conferencing Tools 1 2022 3 2022 • Worked in a team of 3 undergraduates to develop an ML application that automatically transcribes American Sign Language (ASL) for Video-Conferencing Tools like Zoom for finger spelling
• Project Demo: https://youtu.be/AZNTqytOhXk?t=11003
• Developed as Class Project for CS 329S: Machine Learning Systems Design (graduate level course) and won 2nd best project for Judges' Choice Award and 3rd best project for Students' Choice Awards out of 20+ projects
• Developed own custom robust dataset as existing SOTA dataset was very limited. Our dataset has 10,000+ images and was created by working with 5 ASL speakers in our communities
• Our best model was a custom Deep Neural Network combined with a unique Feature Extractor that achieved 0.87 inference accuracy, has minimal latency at inference time resulting in seamless transcription, and is robust to the handedness of the speaker (works with left and right hand signing) 
• Our application is platform agnostic and easily integrates with most existing video conferencing tools: we tested it on Zoom, Microsoft Teams, Skype, Google Meet, Discord, and Facebook Messenger standardizedContributor Sasankh Munukutla Co-Founder @ Terradot | 776 Climate Fellow | AI+Climate @ Stanford Influencer dashboard tool for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) 1 2019 6 2019 • Led 5-student Stanford team to work with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees' (UNHCR)The Hive (special innovation unit) to build an influencer dashboard tool using NLP to identify micro-influencers to improve the sentiment regarding refugees using React, Python.
