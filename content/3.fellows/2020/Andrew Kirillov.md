I am fascinated by the intersection of technology and humanity — the ways in which technology shapes and will continue to shape our lives, and how we may harness it for the better. 

I bring a strong technical background in both theory and practice, currently working as an APM at Uber on Driver Experience. I graduated from Harvard with a dual Bachelor's-Master's degree in Applied Math and Computer Science, and I have taken on several Software Engineering internships in industry, including at Facebook and Mastercard.

At the same time, I am greatly focused on people and impact. As a former Fiction Board Member of Harvard's literary magazine and Associate News Editor of the school newspaper, I also bring a creative bent to my work, imagining worlds unseen and grappling with the nuances of the human experience.
