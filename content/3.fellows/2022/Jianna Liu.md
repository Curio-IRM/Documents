What are you struggling with? Are you hoping to build digital experiences that engage patients, increase operational efficiency, and improve health outcomes? Maybe you're just starting with the basics - building a platform that allows you to understand and track what's going on with your patients and your business. I might be able to help, or at least provide some moral support. ðŸ’ª

amscher.github.io United States San Francisco, California San Francisco California San Francisco, California, United States False False Health, Wellness & Fitness Identifying Factors in Congressional Bill Success 9 2014 12 2014 Analyzed properties of bills such as simple statistics, degree distribution, betweenness centrality on co-sponsorship graphs, PageRank scores for the chair-membership graph. Investigated correlation between a sponsor's financial contributions and the outcome of their bills. Applied matrix factorization to understand the affinity of a particular legislator towards any given bill. These were used to understand the influence of each congress member. Finally, predicted whether a bill is successful or not using machine learning models, with all the above as features. standardizedContributor Montana Scher Co-Founder, CEO at Morf Health (YC S22) 74074638 Morf https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/C560BAQFpm-qULWNiXQ/company-logo_400_400/0/1656613259293?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=xtFzn0PlgQHhK2CwCNF0tYfh_2WHtItZdbiPmR_rVvk https://www.linkedin.com/company/morf-health/ 2 10 2 2022 San Francisco Bay Area 2 2022 Morf Health With Morf, we're making it easy for digital healthcare companies to quickly setup and maintain patient data integrations across their tech stack â€” e.g. easily send structured data from patient intake forms into a EMR. Morf integrates with the tools digital healthcare companies use to deliver care, unifies and normalizes the data from these tools, and then sends the data where it needs to go. Itâ€™s like Zapier or Segment, but built for PHI and health data.
