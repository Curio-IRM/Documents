My end goal is to work on stuff that actively helps to improve people’s lives, and I apply that filter when choosing the teams I work on.

I moved to SF with the goal of working somewhere I can make a clear difference - I've worked + been building products + organizations for a while, and I'm looking to do more!

I’m currently working on Climate Tech at Watershed, and I love it. Still happy to consult / advise on ideas of all kinds, but I’m not looking for a new job!

Interests: Finance, Healthcare, Climate Tech, and Education - but open to anything that will help other people (intentionally vague).

Feel free to message me on LinkedIn or email me directly (ronak.manish.shah@gmail.com).

I tend to use LinkedIn as a place to track my past experiences, so you'll have to forgive some of the granularity.
