https://www.linkedin.com/in/justin-bleuel-6a403431 justinbleuel Justin Bleuel Co-Founder & CEO at Avenue ||  Helping ops teams detect and manage incidents https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E03AQHGCrU_GA-OVA/profile-displayphoto-shrink_800_800/0/1687974903403?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=mV2kI3P5u-Iao8ymakkVcV4mNURjkCRl9ZAVNLnVXOI https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4E16AQESwaDfljx0bw/profile-displaybackgroundimage-shrink_350_1400/0/1688011528495?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=oSatYiDnLzDaMrzynqwF9z62UKNPvJzmHk0W_XSjC_c personal ACoAAAaW4dwBtCFdgdluQxNGReAPlE5S6j3uMiA 110551516 ✔︎ Who gets results
High-growth startups and enterprises, whose ops teams' workflows feel more like fire-fighting than business-building. We automate day-to-day operations for companies like Doordash, AngelList Ventures, Rappi, and Ramp.

✔︎ What we do
Avenue centralizes all of your company's business monitoring systems, ensuring the right person is alerted at the right time and your team is accountable for each follow-up and next step all the way through resolution. Use SQL to define a metric (or start from one of our many templates) and build your playbook to route incidents to the appropriate team,  escalation group, or destination.

✔︎ How to get started
In 10 minutes, set up Avenue and connect to your existing data sources (like Snowflake, BigQuery, Google Sheets) and tools (Slack, Notion, Zendesk, Asana). We integrate with 30+ tools.

✔︎ What Avenue customers are saying
“Avenue is my pulse on all things operations. Our team has peace-of-mind knowing if something urgent happens, the right team is notified and we have a way to ensure incidents are fully resolved.”  -Issam Freiha: Co-Founder & CEO at Blank Street

“Avenue is literally insane. The most impressed I've been with a platform ever.”  -Mark De Paola, Head of CX at Slash

“Avenue lets us easily monitor our increasingly complex system. From customer activity and order inaccuracy to fraud reviews and QA, Avenue keeps our team alert to what’s important.”  -Bowie Cheung: Co-Founder & CEO at Pepper

These are the questions that used to keep Avenue customers up at night:
▶︎ How do we ensure we don't miss important moments in our business?
▶︎ How do we scale our Ops team beyond dashboard-refreshing and fire-fighting?
▶︎ How do we build an Operations System that keeps our team accountable to problems?
▶︎ How do I ensure visibility to important alerts *and* accountability that we're solving them?
▶︎ If my business grows, will I need to, in-kind, grow my Operations team?
