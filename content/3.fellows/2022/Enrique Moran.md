Oberoi International School 8 2017 Table for Four \-\- HackSC 2 2021 2 2021 Drawing inspiration from the New York Time‚Äôs article on the ‚Äú36 Questions to Fall in Love‚Äù and the classic board\-game Sequence, this digital board game ‚Äì Table for Four ‚Äì is built for sparking deeper conversations and creating meaningful connections\.  Similar to Sequence, the motive of the game is to create 4\-token sequences across the board with your assigned team\-member\. The catch: we‚Äôve replaced the deck of cards with a deck of meaningful questions that you have to answer in order to proceed\! While the end\-goal may be competitive, the beauty in this game is the journey to get there ‚Äì The more detailed your answer, the more follow\-ups; the more follow\-ups, the more chances for other players to share their answers too; and the more sharing, the greater the conversation\.  We also wanted to make sure this game could apply to anyone\! From college friends to distant family, we‚Äôve got a version for all types of company you might keep\. The current version available is called "Recess," which is built specifically for friends of all ages\. Other versions we hope to work on soon are: "No Strings Attached" for not super personal but still interesting conversations; "Dinner Table" for family\-friendly / family\-focused bonding time; "Cupid‚Äôs Arrows" for couples; and "Saturday Nights" as our 18\+/party\-setting deck\. standardizedContributor Yashvi Jaju CS, Business, Philosophy at USC | Kleiner Perkins Fellow 2022 | Incoming SWE Intern at Two Sigma | President at TroyLabs | Previously at Slack Smart Tic Tac Toe 8 2020 12 2020 standardizedContributor Yashvi Jaju CS, Business, Philosophy at USC | Kleiner Perkins Fellow 2022 | Incoming SWE Intern at Two Sigma | President at TroyLabs | Previously at Slack Data Structures and Object\-Oriented Design CSCI\-104 Discrete Methods in Computer Science CSCI\-170 Growth Hacking BAEP\-469 Organizational Behavior and Leadership BUAD\-304 Typography DES\-332A 6 2020 Volunteer ProductNation/iSPIRT https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C4E0BAQFBki\_qTsGWBg/company\-logo\_400\_400/0/1606809756249?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=V5aqfD4ML6leXfGHJLoFBqR9l0\-V\_nkDsk8K\_sj3hhw https://www\.linkedin\.com/company/ispirt/ SCIENCE\_AND\_TECHNOLOGY iSPIRT is a non\-profit think\-tank that evangelizes and develops societal tech platforms for developing countries  Project 2: ‚Ä¢ Designed, prototyped, and launched an internal cloud\-based directory used by 350\+ iSPIRT volunteers using Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Next\.js, and MongoDB, thereby improving communication across 50\+ projects and fostering 80\+ mentor\-mentee relations ‚Ä¢ Developed a 4\-tier access\-level system and invite\-based approval process for cybersecurity compliance by integrating with Microsoft Azure AD, OAuth 2\.0 protocols, and Single Sign\-On to considerably reduce data privacy issues ‚Ä¢ Wrote technical documentation for code architecture, development process, and external tools and integrations to increase code maintainability ‚Ä¢ UI Stack: Figma, Adobe Illustrator ‚Ä¢ Tech Stack: MongoDB, Next\.js, Azure Active Directory, OAuth 2\.0  Project 1: The iSPIRT India COVID\-19 SEIR Model is a model that predicts the 15\-30 day impact of coronavirus in districts and states\. ‚Ä¢ Managing the websites for India Covid Model \(indiacovidmodel\.in\) ‚Ä¢ Created data visualisations for the predictive model using Dash Plotly\.
