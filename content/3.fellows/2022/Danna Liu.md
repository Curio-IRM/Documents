We get our daily information from clickbaity newsfeeds, social media echo chambers, and mindless-scroll products riddled with low-nutrient content.

Depending on professional journalists isn't much better -- they're subject to corporate bias and political agendas, they make the news boring by focusing only on "headline-worthy" issues, and their final product is a wall of text that busy people skim rather than read thoroughly.

Our children spend hours a day browsing videos on TikTok, whose parent company openly sends user data to the Chinese government -- a clear national security threat that few people seem to be sufficiently concerned about.

But unlike the traditional media cycle, it doesn't have to be all doom and gloom for our society.

At Shades, we're building a product that provides a healthy information diet, while still being entertaining and fun:
- You see quick summaries of multiple points of view -- fast, comprehensive, and balanced.
- You see a wide variety of topics, from cultural trends to politics to sports to movies to science.
- You can share your own takes and opinions, and see how they evolve over time.

You should follow my LinkedIn page here if you're interested in boosting your own information diet, or that of your children. I post about the future of news and information -- the problems with the current options, and how we can fix them.

A summary of my experiences that have taught me about this industry:
• Co-founder and Chief Product Officer of Shades (https://shades.news), the future of news & information.
• Seed/angel investor and Sequoia Capital Scout (24 total investments since 2016).
• Previously Group Product Manager at Google growing Discover Feed Ads business from scratch to Google-scale revenue.
• Personal projects: iOS developer of four apps on App Store totaling 430,000 total downloads.
• Dual degrees from from UPenn's Jerome Fisher Program in Management & Technology (M&T): B.S. Computer Science from Engineering School, B.S. Economics/Management from Wharton. United States San Francisco, California San Francisco California San Francisco, California, United States True False Computer Software Hackathon projects 9 2012 1 2014 • Electioneering (PennApps: September 14-16, 2012): iOS app to inform users about candidate stances on major issues before the 2012 presidential election.
• Merge (PennApps: January 18-20, 2013): iOS app to help users plan basic activities with friends like studying, eating lunch, or going to the gym.
• Kale (HackNY: April 6-7, 2013): Web and mobile app written in JavaScript to facilitate and optimize audience questions at live speaker events.
• Starfish (Greylock Hackfest: July 27-28, 2013): iOS app that gives users color matches for nail polish after they snap a picture of a friend's nails.
• Pillio (PennApps, September 6-8, 2013): iOS and Android app for users to schedule pill reminders for loved ones in their lives.
