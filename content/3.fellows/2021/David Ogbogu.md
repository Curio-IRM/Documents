Electrochromic materials that readily change color as a function of voltage are ideal candidates for dynamic window applications\. Unfortunately, these materials have yet to be widely commercialized due to complications and tradeoffs associated with color, switching speed, durability, and cost\. In this work, we study the reversible metal electrodeposition of Bi and Cu on a Pt\-functionalized transparent conducting electrode for high\-quality dynamic windows\. We develop a stoichiometrically optimized electrolyte formula to construct 25 cm2 electrochromic devices with bistable, reversibly tunable transmission at fast switching speeds\. Our results show improved deposition uniformity and sheet resistance achieved with the Pt\-modified cathode, and our colorless electrolyte enables great optical performance\. Altogether, our windows demonstrate uniform switching between a clear state, with over 70% transmission, and a color\-neutral black state, with under 15% transmission\. Additionally, our electrochromic devices can be cycled in less than one minute, demonstrating a significant improvement over previous metal\-based dynamic window architectures\. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Handwritten Mathematics to LaTeX Code 4 2018 6 2018 In this study, we present a fully end\-to\-end, deep learning pipeline capable of generating the LaTeX code associated with an input mathematical image\. The model uses an encoder\-decoder architecture with integrated visual and semantic attention mechanisms\. For model training, we leverage a rich dataset of over 100,000 LaTeX images linked to their ground truth markup\. Metrics such as Levenshtein distance and BLEU score were used to assess performance and compare between models\. We managed to achieve a BLEU score of 56% and image edit accuracy of 48%\. Our image\-to\-LaTeX system could benefit students, researchers, and professors alike by saving them valuable time spent transcribing work from paper to PDF\. Such a system might aid in the development of next\-generation grading systems and artificially intelligent notetakers for students with documented disabilities\. With sufficient data, our model could be applied more generally to convert images of other languages, such as handwritten python or C\+\+, into valid markup\. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 18583501 Stealth Startup https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C560BAQH03e0VowA5sQ/company\-logo\_400\_400/0/1523260171056?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=zaqVFlaN7QK4gjWPKqkCO5gohtCvSuXdQPfw6aVzXsc https://www\.linkedin\.com/company/stealth\-startup\-51/ 11 50 6 2022 San Francisco Bay Area 6 2022 Stealth Startup Founder Full\-time Research Solar Cells Statistics Electronics Data Analysis Optimization Machine Learning C\+\+ True 1049 500 michellehpark Michelle Park Cofounder & CEO at \[stealth\] | Stanford AI https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C5603AQEDqHhhrnBpTg/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1602282715297?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=adxt1ikRMGCG5\_IUYxaJFUAbe0QF\_1bJpTriDuO7\_Zg mitch\-adler\-2435a9b Mitch Adler Founder @ Stealth Startup https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C5603AQGNs6kARCnhrw/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1535432868099?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=kkXUgSePPb5dY0CY7S27USDz0OgVCO\-vGOQcPTN9b7g davidgudeman David Gudeman Entrepreneur, Engineer https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C5603AQEimb\_hEwGqkw/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1625178406533?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=eu1GPNi0sUz\_qzJ7lpVI\-UMMUYzvtRp0DGtYAL2DBKk iantolee Han L\.

Quantitative Researcher at Citadel Securities Prediction of Cellular Service Quality 10 2016 12 2017 Used ordinary least squares, support vector regression, and random forest regression to predict the received signal strength indicator \(RSSI\) of mobile devices\. Achieved a root\-mean\-square error \(RMSE\) of 15\.5 dB on RSSI test data ranging from 0 to 250 dB in magnitude\.  Current mobile devices can tell us when a cell signal or WiFi connection is weak; however, they fail to provide useful information for obtaining a better signal\. A compact machine learning model, capable of predicting RSSI from real\-time network conditions and location measurements, could provide mobile device users with a personal heuristic for locating areas of optimal cell service\.  This could also benefit cell service providers in determining a favorable deployment of cell towers over a region\. As cell carrier companies work to improve their coverage by using insights obtained via this predictive algorithm, periodically retraining the model to reflect these targeted improvements results in a positive feedback loop to benefit mobile device users all over the world\. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Tetris AI 9 2017 12 2017 In this project, we take a reinforcement learning approach to play the game of Tetris\. By modeling the game states in terms of the board and current tetromino, we use TD Learning and genetic algorithms to determine an evaluation function for picking the best possible move at each step\. We built six different agents to test combinations of depth\-k search, feature selection, TD learning, and genetic algorithms\. Our top\-performing model was depth\-2 search using the evaluation function found by genetic algorithm\. This model was able to clear over 6,000 lines, beating out even the best human players\. standardizedContributor Maxmillian Minichetti Founder | Stanford '19 Applied Matrix Theory MATH 104 Applied Quantum Mechanics EE 222, 223 Artificial Intelligence: Principles and Techniques CS 221 Circuits EE 101A, 101B Computer Organization and Systems CS 107 Computers, Ethics, and Public Policy CS 181W Convex Optimization EE 364A C\# Python H\.
