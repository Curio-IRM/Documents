Teammates: Ishaan Parikh, Sean Bae PennApps XIII 1 2016 2nd Place, Best Use of Twilio at MHacks VI (Smartify) At MHacks VI, a 1500 person hackathon hosted by the University of Michigan, my team built a service that allowed users to access the internet via text messages. This service relied directly on Twilio to create a static phone number that users could send text messages to and receive text feedback from. We used the Twilio webhooks to enable real-time text message transfer, from the Twilio service to our Azure backend. MHacks, Twilio 9 2015 Best use of IBM Bluemix at PennApps XII (Haptic Vision for the Blind) PennApps during the fall of 2015 was the largest hackathon to date with over 2000 hackers from across the world. More than 300 projects were submitted. My team developed an innovate new way of navigation for those affected by blindness. We used IBM Bluemix extensively to host a Node.JS server that facilitated communication between our hardware while providing an interface for us to utilize IBM Watson to analyze images, identify faces and produce speech from text.

At the spring 2016 HackNY, my team built a web app to provide and enforce dynamic local airspace and FAA regulatory information for hobby pilots while flying their drones. This includes altitude restrictions, prohibited airspaces, large events, potentially dangerous weather and numerous other possible flight inhibitors. The web app provided a real-time video stream and the ability to control your drone with a PlayStation DualShock 4 controller and/or a keyboard. The drone runs a robotics framework, Cylon.js, which allows our web app to communicate to it over socket.io. The regulation data was scraped from Airmap’s APIs by reverse engineering their pre-release demo application. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ OmniTester - Web Load Tester 1 2016 1 2016 At PennApps XIII, my team built a web-based automatic load tester that simplifies the configuration process by scraping your website for API calls and then running a series of stress tests on Linode virtual instances.

Well over 500 hackers attended and 131 projects were submitted. At Hack the Planet, we built the Haptic Web Developer which utilized the cutting-edge Sensel to allow anyone to draw our their websites. Once a user is done, they simply tap the Sensel with both hands to immediately deploy to the internet. Behind the scenes, the content they drew is converted to HTML using cutting-edge CSS grid system. The HTML file is automatically transferred to a S3 instance on AWS which users can access securely over the internet.

At PennApps 2015--the largest hackathon to date with over 2000 students--we developed a prototype system for allowing blind people to navigate an environment using the IR cameras from within Leap Motion sensors, haptic feedback from internet-connected Pebble watches and the processing capabilities of IBM Bluemix and Wolfram Cloud. The majority of the application was developed in Node.JS (Bluemix server and Pebble application) or Python (Leap Motion interface scripts).

At MHacks VI, a 1500 person hackathon hosted by the University of Michigan, my team built a system to allow people who do not have access to the internet (either because they own a feature phone, or internet is not available in their area) to still access internet-connected applications by leveraging the power of SMS and the cloud. We used Twilio to create an accessible phone number that users can text. A server running on Microsoft Azure is set up to listen to the webhooks associated with this phone number and will pull any new text messages from Twilio. These texts are parsed and new application instances are started. A core framework is provided that will provide the parsed commands to an application which can do anything a normal internet-connected application would do, and will return the application's results to the user via text messages. On the developer end, we created a full featured web-based IDE and app store that provide developers with an area to create applications on top of our core framework and immediately deploy them to AWS courtesy of real-time syncing via Firebase. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Algorithms CMSC351 Applied Probability and Statistics STAT400 Applied Probability and Statistics II STAT401 Calculus III MATH241 Coding the Matrix: Linear Algebra through Computer Science Applications Computer Science Honors Seminar CMSC396H Developing Data Products 8 2012 5 2014 Calculus, Physics and Chemistry Tutor Towson High School EDUCATION Amazon Web Services (AWS) Leadership Gannon Portal Scholarship This scholarship recognizes outstanding computer science undergraduates early in their studies.

UMD CS Department 6 2015 3rd Prize and KPCB Build for Good Challenge Winner at RevolutionUC (Pencils of Promise Mobile Education Hub) The Mobile Education Hub was created in order to allow EdX courses to be used without the need of the internet in countries where internet is not commonly available. The KPCB Build for Good challenges are a set of open innovation challenges that are made in partnership with “for purpose” organizations tackling some of the world’s toughest problems. This challenge in particular addresses a need by the Pencils of Promise, an organization aiming at improving the world through education, for a "technological solution that will support our staff while providing our teachers with the necessary tools to increase student achievement through literacy and numeracy."

At Hack the Planet, we developed Haptic Web Developer which utilizes the cutting-edge Sensel to allow anyone to draw out their websites and instantly deploy to AWS. Utilizing tapping, swiping, and dragging motions, you are able to add text boxes, shaped regions, and images to a web layout.
In order to develop this project, our team developed a gesture framework in Python (similar to Gesture Recognizers for iOS) that could convert the raw data that the Sensel registered into different gestures such as taps and pans. From here, we built a Python application using Tkinter that showed the user what they were drawing. Once the user was finished, we developed a method for automatically converting the drawn content into HTML using a cutting-edge CSS grid system and completely scripted  the process of deploying to AWS. standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ Mobile Education Hub 5 2015 5 2015 Awarded: 3rd Place and KPCB Build for Good Challenge

The Mobile Education Hub was a hackathon project built at RevolutionUC (University of Cincinnati's annual MLH-sponsored hackathon). This project addresses a "Build-for-Good"​ challenge released by KPCB and Pencils of Promise. Pencils of Promise is an organization that makes tremendous impact by vastly improving education in developing communities throughout the world. This hub allows Pencils of Promise educators to create innovative and interactive multimedia courses using the OpenEdx platform. This hub does not rely on the internet, so it is well-fit for 3rd world countries where a lack of a reliable connection is commonplace. Instead, the hub is designed to spread courses via it's own local area network. Each hub is made up of a Raspberry Pi B+ running a custom-made OpenEdx image and an Arduino hooked to a GSM modem to create SMS-based discussion forums. Each hub is completely self-operational and can function without anything other than a power source (which can come in the form of solar power). standardizedContributor Colin King ✌️ standardizedContributor Hiroshi Furuya Trustees Doctoral Fellow at University of Central Florida Discrete Structures CMSC250 Exploratory Data Analysis Foundations in Cybersecurity HACS100 Foundations in Cybersecurity II HACS102 Intro to Computer Science II - Summer class at Towson University Introduction to Computer Systems CMSC216 Introduction to Statistical Computing with SAS STAT430 MongoDB for Node.js Developers M101JS Object-Oriented Programming II CMSC132 Oral Communication INAG110 Organization of Programming Languages CMSC330 Practical Machine Learning R Programming Project Management Swift OCaml Objective-C HTML CSS C Cybersecurity Software Engineering React Best Use of Intel Edison Development System at PennApps XI (SmartCan) PennApps is the premier student-run college hackathon.

Hacks were made based off of problem statements submitted by charities and other organizations in order to focus hacks on real world problems. My team worked to tackle the lack of safe, anonymous and secure methods for Bangladesh workers to report unfair and potentially dangerous working conditions. Workers are able to text a number with a complaint and a natural language version of their location and this will be saved in our Firebase database where it is accessed from and displayed on our Node.js site that Federation/Union leaders can access. This allows these leaders to anonymously view complaints and respond in an adequate matter.
