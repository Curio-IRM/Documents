https://www.linkedin.com/in/pfarejowicz pfarejowicz Peter Farejowicz Software Engineer at Instagram personal ACoAABD7knUBsieLp36eGYKu8yayGlurvrMi_64 284922485 I'm a software engineer with a background in Human-Computer Interaction and Economics from Stanford University.

I'm currently helping small business owners build and grow their business at Instagram. Previously I've worked on creator and shopping products at Pinterest. Some of my roles in these projects include taking a product from ideation to execution, creating a holistic experience across multiple platforms, and leading long-term and short-term product vision.
