The work of executing tasks is exported from a user’s device to our servers, and made accessible through an easy, existing medium on anyone’s phone.  Using the platform, developers and users alike can configure SMS to accomplish anything they desire.

• Led the development of a metrics platform, which manages hundreds of defined metrics, utilizing a Java spring boot gRPC service with graphQL query support for data fetching, dbt for data preparation executed in Airflow DAGs, and Python for job logic. Worked directly with several partner engineering teams to ensure the platform met their needs and helped them onboard their metrics. Resulted in a low-friction format for defining metrics and a unified system for handling data preparation and querying. The platform handles several million API requests per day with p99 latency of under 1s.

• Led the design and development of a scheduled reporting service, using Java microservices, gRPC, and Temporal to execute report generation workflows.

• Acted as the main developer on graphQL APIs for web UI reporting capabilities, such as configurable dashboards for viewing grouped and filtered performance metrics data, used by clients to understand the performance of their text message and email marketing campaigns.

• Acted as a mentor for engineers on my immediate team and across the engineering organization.

• Experience working with Terraform for infrastructure management, Helm for Kubernetes service deployments, Apache Flink and Spark for event data ETL pipelines, s3 and PostgresSQL for data storage, and Snowflake for data warehousing.
