The technology exists to decarbonize the world — it's just too difficult for companies to deploy today. Watershed's software platform changes that, helping companies measure their carbon impact. We show decision-makers across the company where every kilogram of carbon comes from so they can make a precise, year-by-year plan to aggressively reduce it, and share the results with investor-grade reporting.

We work with the most ambitious companies on their climate programs, including Stripe, Shopify, Airbnb, Square, and more. We’re growing fast and hiring across the board! Come join us!
