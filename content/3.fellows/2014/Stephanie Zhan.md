In this capacity I manage a team of product managers through all parts of operating an at\-scale internet product \- ideation, backlog prioritization, spec development, feature implementation, release management, tuning, data analysis, feature readouts, data\-driven investigations, and feature iteration\. I have been a people manager since 2017\.   My experience has taught me to be as enthusiastic about the strategic pieces of product management as the weeds of execution in order to deliver excellent results\. I believe in defining goals clearly up front and holding that goal as a north star through the development process\. By partnering closely with stakeholders across levels and disciplines, I have developed crisp communication, thick skin, and a strong ability to recall facts\. Above all, I strive to be resilient and empathetic as a colleague and a leader\.
