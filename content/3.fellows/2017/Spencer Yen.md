I like working with people because faster feedback and alignment push me forward and give me more confidence over the strength of the design\. Communication, feedback, and inclusivity are at the core of my design\.   üëâ I'm looking forward to work in an energetic company where I can continue to grow my knowledge and work on product that help people have a better life\.   I am continuing my education at the Minerva University, an innovative undergraduate university that highlights problem solving\. I have traveled to six world cities to work with different organizations and identify sustainable ways to solve problems\. Topics I am very interested in right now include üè° housing justice, üíßgender equality, and üç± food security\.
