I've spent the last ~3 years leading design at Studio \(formerly Monthly\), where we provide hands on, cohort based classes taught by your favorite creators including Kygo, Charlie Puth, Christina Tosi, Mark Rober, Casey Neistat and more\. As the founding designer at seed stage, I led design on many 0 to 1 initiatives that would eventually becomes foundations for new experiences\. As we grew and evolved into a Series B company, I helped recruit, manage and empower a team of 4 while still contributing as an IC\.  I'm currently looking for my next adventure as either a lead level IC or managing and leading a design team\. I thrive in environments where problems are ambiguous, the opportunity areas are endless, and the impact that design can have is immense\.
