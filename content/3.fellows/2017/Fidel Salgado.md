What it does: NotiFire is a multi\-platform app that uses crowdsourced data from users and Twitter to display information about animals/people in need, help centers, and the active location of fires on the map\. There is a mobile version where users can upload information about animals/people in trouble and view the map on the go\. Additionally, there is a web version where users can, in more detail, view the map with all of its information\.  How we built it: We used Python and the FastAPI Framework to develop a backend API for both platforms\. We then used Flutter to create the mobile version of the app and ReactJS to create the web version\. Some of the technologies we utilized include the Google Maps API, Breezometer API, and Google Image Recognition API\.  Challenges we ran into: It was hard trying to create both mobile and web versions of the app\. There was a learning curve to picking up the new APIs and backend framework\. We definitely spent most of our time on the frontend, trying to get the data to load on the map and read from our backend API\. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M CloseCash \(HackRice Winner\) 9 2019 9 2019 Inspiration: For a lot of us, ATMs seem to be far away when we need them the most\. People who are serviced by local banks often can't find familiar ATMs to withdraw from if they can find one at all\. For the 3 of us personally, we are tired of paying extra fees and borrowing money from friends\. We'd like to get the cash we need when we need it\. That's why we thought of creating a peer\-to\-peer ATM system that matches receivers and tellers to each other based on location and price, all thanks to Capital One and Google's API\.  What it does: Allows users that need close cash to match with tellers that are ranked in a list based on location and amount of cash on hand\. The application consists of a receiver and teller interface, your most recent transaction, and a ranked search for the closest teller\.  How we built it: The app was built using Node\.js/MongoDB in the backend and ReactJS in the front end\. We utilized Capital One's API to create and use customer ids to make transactions in the application\. Additionally, we used the Google Maps API to find a users location for the searching and ranking algorithm\. Lastly, we made heavy use of Passport\.js, Sessions, Cookies, and Axios to secure user data and communicate between multiple servers\.  Challenges we ran into: Initially, we planned for too many features and we're heavily stressing over getting it all done\. After innovating and figuring out what features really matter, we were able to spend more time on debugging big issues and developing a robust system\. Some of the big technical problems we faced had to do with sending Cookies and Sessions from the back\-end to the front\-end, learning ReactJS for an elegant UI, and interacting with both the APIs we used\.  What we learned: We learned a ton about MERN stack development and working with a separate front\-end and back\-end server\. Most of our project consisted of technologies we had never used before such as ReactJS, Google Maps API, Capital One API, and other JS packages\. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M 18311685 Moveworks https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C560BAQFiEwMbt6hJrQ/company\-logo\_400\_400/0/1568244969590?e=1698278400&v=beta&t=gsCEvnyn9Tq2nvUbKgdLVQck6Tqzwua3C3\_UVpFV6os https://www\.linkedin\.com/company/moveworksai/ 501 1000 1 2022 Mountain View, California, United States 6 2022 Moveworks Product Manager, Integrations & Extensibility  Full\-time Product Management Web Development Python C\+\+ Logo Design Marketing Branding & Identity HTML True 709 500 ajayrajmerchia Ajay Merchia Group Product Manager @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | CS \+ Haas, UC Berkeley https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C4D03AQG31qfdyRtzyA/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1637075395115?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=HpNhwa0rBbgLQfBDRh8vgfFwOxgRr85UujmkEAadj\_0 fadynaeim Fady Naeim Product @ Moveworks https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/D5603AQESFzy14LILzQ/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1673448774726?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=aoXCrNrZnVHImqHfxGvjB10JnBEku7A\-C4YzxDJgLwE anakp525 Ana Parra Product @ Moveworks üë©üèªü™Ñüíª https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C4D03AQF\-TLWPr2f5kg/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1647901018380?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=IV2KCJV8yN6YrXnw9K95mD0L7BjLmPjMuSwMSmlYw\_8 karenzxy XinYi\(Karen\) Zheng Product @ Uber | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | CS \+ Business @ UPenn M&T https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C5603AQGnYcRiliRwHQ/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1655795930990?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=qD2Uh\_IRd\_7i\_5uA2Yt7p5q9jYc7rKSMF\-cRs9T3U5M oliver\-zou Oliver Zou Product @ Uber yatinag Yatin Agarwal Product @ Moveworks | CS @ UC Berkeley https://media\.licdn\.com/dms/image/C5603AQFvGEbsxmmSWQ/profile\-displayphoto\-shrink\_800\_800/0/1593822459727?e=1695859200&v=beta&t=Agtdzj10mbyZw7WsE666jFSjbImkuE3FBpRR1eT5zMM charlesmjenkins C\.J\.

It's also very difficult to learn the numerous technologies it takes to build a successful application on top of school work and extra\-curriculars\. That's why we wanted to build a fast\-paced and short\-term developer matching app to allow students at Texas A&M to quickly start projects together based on their shared interests and skills\.  What it does: Matches student developers to each other and encourages collaboration on projects\. This was specifically implemented by using a "discover" page where you can briefly read about fellow devs and decide if you'd like to work with them\. If a match is found, a live chat will open so more details can be shared and a project can be done\. The concept and UI are very lean so students are encouraged to act fast and take their projects seriously\.  How we built it: We used Node\.js/Express\.js/MongoDB for the backend and HTML/Sass/EJS for the front\-end\. We also implemented libraries like Passport and Google OAuth 2\.0 for secure login\. Additionally, we had a big focus on ease\-of\-use UI so we heavily depended on Socket\.io and EJS templates to create highly dynamic webpages\. standardizedContributor Lucas Rollo Product @ Moveworks | Kleiner Perkins Fellow | Honors CS @ Texas A&M BestFit \(Aggies Invent Winner\) 12 2018 8 2019 BestFit is a mobile and web app concept that allows users to accurately try on clothes for themselves and friends virtually\. The app utilizes Augmented Reality \(AR\) to allow users to create an accurate 3D model of themselves and then have the ability to search for and try on clothes for an elevated retail experience\.   Our concept won 2nd place at Aggies Invent in December 2018 and has continued development since\. We also be competed at the Engineering Project Showcase in April 2019\.  Currently, the team consists of 3 engineering students with a wide variety of skills and abilities\.
