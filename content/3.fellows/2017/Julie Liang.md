Massachusetts Institute of Technology and  National Aeronautics and Space Administration 1 2015 MuseThinks 4 2016 4 2016 MuseThinks is a seizure detecting IoT device that is able to interact with your phone and contact authorities/emergency contacts upon seizure detection. It uses the Muse Headband as the primary device to detect seizures (we analyzed brainwaves using it's EEG sensor), as well as the Intel Edison as the primary IoT interactions. We connected Arduino's to the Edison for allowing many larger scale IoT interactions, such as unlocking the door to allow medical staff to easily come in the home and help the patient. standardizedContributor Mayank Makwana building something new | ex lyft, kp, startups CourseConvert 11 2015 11 2015 This web application takes in a video URL as input and translates it into any language allowing viewers from any country to understand the contents of the video.
